FAST API ROLE BASED ACCESS
A RESTful API built with FastAPI that implements JWT authentication and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) using PostgreSQL and SQLModel.

**Features**
User Registration & Login: Secure user registration and authentication
JWT Authentication: Token-based authentication with automatic expiration
Role-Based Access Control: Admin and user roles with different permissions
Password Security: Bcrypt hashing for secure password storage
CRUD Operations: Complete project management with role-based restrictions
PostgreSQL Integration: Robust database storage with SQLModel ORM

**Tech Stack**
FastAPI: Modern, fast web framework for building APIs
SQLModel: SQL databases in Python, designed for simplicity and compatibility
PostgreSQL: Advanced open-source relational database
JWT: JSON Web Tokens for secure authentication
Bcrypt: Secure password hashing
Python 3.10/3.11: Modern Python with type hints


**API Endpoints**
Authentication
POST /register - Register a new user
POST /login - Login and receive JWT token
GET /me - Get current user information
Projects (CRUD)
GET /projects - Get all projects (authenticated users)
POST /projects - Create a new project (admin only)
GET /projects/{id} - Get specific project (authenticated users)
PUT /projects/{id} - Update project (admin only)
DELETE /projects/{id} - Delete project (admin only)

Installation & Setup
Prerequisites
Python 3.10 or 3.11
PostgreSQL 12+ (installed and running)
Step 1: Clone and Setup Python Environment
```bash

Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url> cd fastapi-jwt-rbac

Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

Activate virtual environment
On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt ```

Step 2: Database Setup
Install PostgreSQL (if not already installed):

Windows: Download from https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/
macOS: brew install postgresql
Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib
Start PostgreSQL service:

Windows: PostgreSQL should start automatically
macOS: brew services start postgresql
Ubuntu/Debian: sudo systemctl start postgresql
Run the database setup script: ```bash python setup_database.py ``` This will:

Create a database named fastapi_rbac
Create a user fastapi_user with appropriate permissions
Generate a .env file with database configuration
Step 3: Initialize Database Tables
```bash


Seed the database with sample data
python scripts/seed_data.py ```
This creates:
Admin user: admin / admin123
Regular user: user / user123
Sample projects

Step 4: Run the Application
Start the FastAPI server
uvicorn main:app --reload ```

The API will be available at:
API: http://localhost:8000
Interactive docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
ReDoc: http://localhost:8000/redoc
Environment Configuration
Create a .env file in the project root (or use the one generated by setup_database.py):

```env DATABASE_URL=postgresql://fastapi_user:fastapi_password@localhost:5432/fastapi_rbac SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-change-this-in-production ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30 ```
Example Endpoints:
1. User Registration:
○ POST /register
○ Body: { "username": "example", "password": "password123",
"role": "user" }

2. User Login:
○ POST /login
○ Body: { "username": "example", "password": "password123" }
○ Response: { "access_token": "JWT_TOKEN" }
3. Get Projects (for all users):
○ GET /projects
○ (Requires JWT)
4. Create Project (admin only):
○ POST /projects
○ Body: { "name": "Project A", "description": "Description of
project" }
○ (Requires JWT with admin role)
